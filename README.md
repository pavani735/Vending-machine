# Vending Machine in Verilog

This project simulates a vending machine using Verilog. It supports multiple inputs (coins) and delivers the appropriate product or change based on user input and configuration.

## Features
- Accepts multiple coin denominations.
- Returns change if overpayment occurs.
- Outputs the selected product.
- Implements a finite state machine (FSM) design.

## Project Structure
- `vending_machine.v`: Main Verilog file with the vending machine logic.
- `testbench.v`: Testbench for simulating the vending machine.

## How to Run
1. Use a Verilog simulator like ModelSim or Xilinx ISE.
2. Load the `vending_machine.v` file.
3. Run the testbench (`testbench.v`) to verify functionality.

## Requirements
- Verilog simulator.
- Basic understanding of Verilog.
